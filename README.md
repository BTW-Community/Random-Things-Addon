# Random Things  
random things is an addon that adds two simple things  
1. three seperate buttons to switch perspective instead of one button to cycle between them all  
2. a speedrun timer including both in game time and real life time  

# Things i never added that can be added by you!  
1. saving keybinds, i didnt figure out how to do that untill after i stopped working on the addon, but if you want an idea of how you could do it maybe look at this addon https://github.com/jeffinitup/btw-freelook/tree/CE-3.0.0  
2. maybe putting the timers in a better place, i did see one fork about it so i guess technically its been done ( https://github.com/Tetro48/Random-Things-Addon ), i guess maybe you could put them in the f3 screen? it is pretty empty in btw anyways!  

# THIS ADDON IS NOT BEING WORKED ON ANYMORE (not by me at least)!  
however, you're free to fork it and keep working on it! just please credit me!
